- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) for quick testing

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React Native & Expo** – Cross-platform mobile & web app development
- **Google Gemini API** – AI-driven conversations
- **expo-speech** – AI voice output
- **expo-speech-recognition** – Converts speech to text


## ⚠️ Important Note

This project uses the **expo-speech-recognition** library to convert speech to text. Additionally, this project contains **Swift and Kotlin code**, meaning **you cannot use it in the Expo Go app**. The Expo Go app is pre-compiled with select packages for the specific Expo version.

To run your app properly, you need to compile your own **development client** by running:
```bash
npx expo run:android 
# or
npx expo run:ios
```
You should see your app's name and icon on the launcher instead of "Expo Go." Do **not** open Expo Go; instead, open your compiled app.

## 🌍 Deployment

To deploy the app, use Expo EAS:
```bash
eas build --platform all
```
For more details, follow the [EAS Build Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/).
